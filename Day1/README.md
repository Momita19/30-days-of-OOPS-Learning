## Objects in javascript
- an object is fundamental unit/building blocks of code that represents the specific instance of a class.
- It can be defined as the data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.
- most important data type, which holds multiple values and properties
- an object is a collection of related data and functions, known as properties and method, resp.

### - Properties
- properties are *"key:value"* pairs that stores data
### - methods
- methods are functions associated with the object that can manipulate its properties.

"note" : *Object() can be called with or without new. Both create a new object.*
Example:

```const o = new Object();o.foo = 42; console.log(o)```
